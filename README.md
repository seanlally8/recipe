# recipe

A web app for making shopping lists and collecting recipes.

This app is being developed as the final project for <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2021/">Harvard's CS50</a>, taught by David Malan. It is currently in its early phases, but I will be updating this readme as I get closer to completion.

To Dos
- [ ] app.py line 107 write a condition to see if that url already exists in the database -- maybe even right after url is defined above? (done needs checking)
- [ ] buttress.py line 25 create a modal using bootstrap to update error.html (or maybe layout.html?) to be a bit more UX friendly
- [ ] app.py line 142 write a function in data model or buttress that just fetches the title_id
- [ ] app.py line 148 check to make sure the user doesn't already have the recipe in their book
