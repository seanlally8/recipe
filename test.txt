salt and pepper.

quartered mushrooms and cook, tossing occa-
sionally, until browned in places, 5 to 7 minutes.
Add minced garlic and butter beans, and cook
until beans are heated through, 2 to 4 minutes.
Turn off the heat and add basil leaves, lemon
zest, and a pinch of salt and pepper.

and pan-roasted mushrooms and butter
beans, and serve with lemon zucchini.
